# Project Title: Walmart Store Sales Prediction with Holiday Markdown Analysis

Objective:
This project addresses the challenge of modeling retail data, particularly the need to make informed decisions based on limited historical sales data. The focus is on predicting department-wide sales for 45 Walmart stores, each located in different regions. The dataset includes historical sales data for various departments in each store, along with the added complexity of holiday markdown events known to impact sales. The project aims to develop a predictive model that accounts for the effects of markdowns, especially during prominent holiday weeks, such as the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.

Description:
The dataset provided for this project includes historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores, each featuring multiple departments. Participants in the project are tasked with predicting the sales for each department in each store. The challenge is compounded by the inclusion of selected holiday markdown events, which are known to influence sales but pose difficulties in predicting the specific departments affected and the extent of their impact.

Walmart conducts promotional markdown events throughout the year, particularly preceding major holidays. Notably, the weeks encompassing these holidays are weighted five times higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks. One of the key challenges in this competition is effectively modeling the effects of markdowns on these holiday weeks in the absence of complete or ideal historical data.

To tackle this challenge, participants are encouraged to utilize historical markdown data to enhance the accuracy of store sales predictions. The project not only emphasizes the development of accurate predictive models but also underscores the importance of understanding and incorporating the impact of promotional events, especially during holiday periods.

The code and analysis for this project are available in this GitHub repository, facilitating transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration in advancing predictive modeling in the retail sector.
